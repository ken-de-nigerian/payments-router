## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **DriverFactory - OCP Compliance Improvement**
  - Removed hardcoded special cases for driver class resolution (opay, nowpayments, paypal)
  - All providers now explicitly define `driver_class` in config for consistency
  - Maintains OCP (Open/Closed Principle) - new providers require only config changes
  - Convention-based resolution remains as fallback for custom drivers
  - Improves maintainability and clarity - no more guessing which drivers need special handling

### Benefits

- **Consistency**: All providers follow the same explicit configuration pattern
- **OCP Compliance**: No code changes needed when adding new providers
- **Clarity**: Explicit `driver_class` makes driver resolution clear and self-documenting
- **Extensibility**: New providers can be added via config only

### Upgrade Notes

**This is a MINOR version release (1.8.0) - fully backward compatible with v1.7.0**

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All existing subscription code continues to work without modification
- All new features are opt-in or enabled by default with sensible defaults
- No API changes to existing methods

**Optional Setup Steps:**

1. **Run Migrations** (if using subscription transaction logging)
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```
   This creates the `subscription_transactions` table if it doesn't exist.

2. **Update Configuration** (optional - defaults work out of the box)
   Add subscription configuration to `config/payments.php` if you want to customize:
   ```php
   'subscriptions' => [
       'prevent_duplicates' => env('PAYMENTS_SUBSCRIPTIONS_PREVENT_DUPLICATES', false),
       'logging' => [
           'enabled' => env('PAYMENTS_SUBSCRIPTIONS_LOGGING_ENABLED', true),
           'table' => env('PAYMENTS_SUBSCRIPTIONS_LOGGING_TABLE', 'subscription_transactions'),
       ],
       // ... other settings
   ],
   ```

3. **Update Event Listeners** (optional - only if using lifecycle events)
   If you want to use the new lifecycle events:
   ```php
   // app/Providers/EventServiceProvider.php
   protected $listen = [
       \KenDeNigerian\PayZephyr\Events\SubscriptionCreated::class => [
           \App\Listeners\HandleSubscriptionCreated::class,
       ],
       // ... other events
   ];
   ```

**New Features (All Opt-in):**
- Transaction logging (enabled by default, can be disabled via config)
- Idempotency (optional, use `->idempotency()` method)
- Query builder (new `Payment::subscriptions()` method)
- Lifecycle events (optional, register listeners if needed)

**Upgrade Time:**
- **0 minutes** - Works immediately with existing code
- **5-10 minutes** - If you want to configure new features

## [1.1.4] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed
- **Square Driver**: Fixed payment verification flow and improved code quality
  - Added missing `location_ids` parameter to order search API request (fixes "Must provide at least 1 location_id" error)
  - Fixed verification to handle `payment_link_id` (providerId) in addition to `reference_id`
  - Added payment link lookup as a verification strategy before order search fallback
  - Verification now supports three strategies: payment ID → payment link ID → reference ID order search

### Changed
- **Square Driver**: Refactored `verify()` method for better maintainability
  - Extracted verification logic into focused helper methods:
    - `verifyByPaymentId()` - handles direct payment ID lookup
    - `verifyByPaymentLinkId()` - handles payment link ID lookup
    - `verifyByReferenceId()` - handles reference ID order search
    - `searchOrders()` - encapsulates order search API call
    - `getOrderById()` - retrieves order by ID
    - `getPaymentFromOrder()` - extracts payment ID from order tenders
    - `getPaymentDetails()` - retrieves payment details by ID
  - Reduced main `verify()` method from ~135 lines to ~27 lines
  - Eliminated code duplication and improved testability
  - All 659 tests passing (1,336 assertions)

## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-09

### Changed
- **Core Classes**: Marked all core classes as `final` for better OCP compliance
  - All driver classes (PayPalDriver, StripeDriver, SquareDriver, PaystackDriver, FlutterwaveDriver, MonnifyDriver)
  - Core service classes (PaymentManager, DriverFactory, StatusNormalizer, ProviderDetector, ChannelMapper)
  - Controller and model classes (WebhookController, PaymentTransaction, Payment, PaymentServiceProvider)
  - All exception classes
  - This prevents inheritance and enforces composition, improving code maintainability

### Fixed
- **Square Driver**: Updated API version and cleaned up logging
  - Updated Square API version from `2024-01-18` to `2024-10-18`
  - Removed debug logging added for troubleshooting 401 authentication errors
  - Cleaned up unnecessary logs while maintaining essential operational logging
  - Updated SquareDriverCoverageTest to reflect new API version

- **Tests**: Refactored all test files to work with final classes
  - Replaced partial mocks of final driver classes with real instances and HTTP client mocking via `setClient()` method
  - Updated PaymentManager tests to use real instances with reflection-based driver injection into internal cache
  - Replaced DriverFactory mocks with direct driver injection into PaymentManager
  - Fixed status normalizer expectations in WebhookControllerCoverageTest to match actual driver behavior
  - Updated PayPalDriverWebhookTest to properly mock StreamInterface for HTTP response bodies
  - All 659 tests now pass successfully (1,336 assertions)

### Technical Details
- Tests now use composition (injecting mocks via public setters/reflection) instead of inheritance
- PaymentManager tests inject mock drivers directly into the internal `$drivers` cache using reflection
- Driver tests mock HTTP clients instead of extending final driver classes
- Maintains full test coverage while respecting final class constraints (OCP compliance)
- Improved test isolation by using real instances where possible

## [1.1.2] - 2025-12-09

### Feature

- Integrated Square driver providing:
- Comprehensive test coverage (41 tests, 68 assertions)
- Complete documentation updates across all docs
- Full integration with existing test suites
- Verification of all OCP methods (extractWebhookReference, extractWebhookStatus, extractWebhookChannel, resolveVerificationId)
- The Square driver is now fully tested, documented, and ready for production use.


## [1.0.9] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

- **Stripe Webhook Validation**: Enhanced webhook signature validation with improved error messages and troubleshooting hints. Fixed validation failures by ensuring proper webhook secret configuration.
- **Flutterwave Webhook Validation**: Improved webhook validation with better error handling and logging. Added support for `FLUTTERWAVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` configuration option.
- **SQLite Database Locks**: Increased webhook throttle limit from 60 to 120 requests per minute to reduce concurrent database lock issues when using SQLite cache driver. Added documentation note recommending `file` or `array` cache drivers for webhook routes.

### Improved

- **Webhook Error Messages**: Enhanced error messages for both Stripe and Flutterwave webhook validation failures with specific troubleshooting hints and configuration guidance.
- **Configuration**: Added `webhook_secret` option to Flutterwave configuration for dedicated webhook secret management (falls back to `secret_key` for backward compatibility).

### Changed

- **Webhook Throttling**: Increased throttle limit for webhook routes from 60 to 120 requests per minute to better handle concurrent webhook deliveries from payment providers.

---
## [1.0.8] - 2025-12-08

### Refactor

- **Moved provider-specific logic to drivers**: All webhook data extraction and verification ID resolution logic is now encapsulated in individual driver classes.
- **Eliminated hardcoded match statements**: `WebhookController` and `PaymentManager` no longer contain provider-specific `match ($provider)` statements.
- **New driver methods**: Added four new methods to `DriverInterface`:
  - `extractWebhookReference()` - Extract payment reference from webhook payload
  - `extractWebhookStatus()` - Extract payment status from webhook payload
  - `extractWebhookChannel()` - Extract payment channel from webhook payload
  - `resolveVerificationId()` - Resolve the ID needed for payment verification
- **Benefits**:
  - Adding new providers no longer requires modifying core classes
  - Each driver encapsulates its own data extraction logic
  - Follows SOLID principles (Open/Closed Principle)
  - Easier to test and maintain


## [1.0.7] - 2025-12-07

### Fixed

- Implement cache-first verification to support Unified API without DB logging
- PaymentManager: Now caches 'CustomRef ⇒ ProviderID' mapping for 1 hour during charge().
- PaymentManager: verify() uses Cache → DB → Prefix logic to find the correct Provider and ID.
- StripeDriver: Added support for verification via Checkout Session ID (cs_).
- MonnifyDriver: Fixed verification failure caused by query parameters in reference string.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-12-07

### Fixed

- StripeDriver charge() must use config callbackUrl as fallback to prevent empty success_url error when using →charge().

## [1.0.5] - 2025-12-07

### Fixed

- Implement cache-based provider resolution for verify()
- Ensures fast verification for custom references even if database logging is disabled.
- Resolution Priority: Explicit → Cache → Database → Prefix → Fallback Loop.

## [1.0.4] - 2025-12-07

### Fixed
- Standardize callback URL query parameters across all drivers
- AbstractDriver: Added appendQueryParam helper for safe URL construction.
- Drivers (Flutterwave, Monnify, PayPal, Stripe): Updated charge methods to explicitly append the 'reference' query parameter to the callback URL.
- This ensures a unified developer experience where Payment::verify(\$request→reference) works consistently for all providers.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-12-07

### Changed
- **PayPal:** Updated the default checkout flow to use `landing_page => GUEST_CHECKOUT`. This ensures users see the "Pay with Debit/Credit Card" option immediately instead of being forced to log in, significantly improving conversion rates.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-12-07

### Fixed
- **Flutterwave:** Fixed `404 Not Found` error caused by incorrect URL path resolution. Removed leading slashes in `FlutterwaveDriver` methods to ensure endpoints correctly append to the configured versioned base URL (`/v3/`).
- **PayPal:** Fixed `422 Unprocessable Entity` error by refactoring the payload to use the modern `experience_context` structure instead of the deprecated `application_context`.
- **PayPal:** Fixed "Cannot redirect to an empty URL" crash. The driver now correctly identifies the `payer-action` link type returned by the API v2, which replaced the previous `approve` link type.
- **Monnify:** Fixed a syntax error (missing comma) in the published `config/payments.php` file that caused application crashes during boot.

### Documentation
- **Monnify:** Added inline documentation in the configuration file to clarify the correct Base URLs for Sandbox (`https://sandbox.monnify.com`) vs. Live (`https://api.monnify.com`) environments.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-04
